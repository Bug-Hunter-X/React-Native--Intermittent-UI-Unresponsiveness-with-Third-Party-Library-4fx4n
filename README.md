# React Native: Intermittent UI Unresponsiveness

This repository demonstrates a bug related to intermittent UI unresponsiveness in a React Native application when using a third-party library. The issue appears to stem from improper event handling within the library, causing conflicts and preventing other components from responding to user interactions.

## Problem

The application exhibits unpredictable behavior, with certain UI elements becoming unresponsive or reacting incorrectly under certain conditions. This is particularly noticeable when using gestures or interacting with elements near the third-party library component. The issue is challenging to debug due to its intermittent nature.

## Solution

The solution involves carefully examining the third-party library's event handling mechanisms.  Strategies to mitigate the issue include:

1. **Event System Override:** In certain cases, overriding or selectively disabling event listeners within the third-party library might resolve the conflict.
2. **Component Reordering:**  Experimenting with the order of components in the render tree can sometimes alleviate the problem. 
3. **Library Update:** Check for updates to the third-party library to see if the developers have already addressed the issue.
4. **Alternative Library:** If the problem persists, consider using an alternative library with more robust event handling.
